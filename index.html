          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I’m an aspiring web developer who loves solving challenging problems. I'm new to the tech industry, so learning programming languages and creating these projects is a testament to my desire to want to problem solve. I’m excited to bring my life experience to the process of building fantastic looking websites.</p>
          <p>Currently I work full time as a CMM operator for an aerospace manufacturing company. I mainly operate a machine that uses the programming language called "PC-DMIS". Although I am not working with this language I am excited to make the transition from "User" to programmer and show you my journey along the way!</p>

            <h3>A Brief History of My Career.</h3>
          <p>After Graduating high school I decided college wasnt for me and I began working right away. At 18 my first job was at Dunkin Donuts.After working at Dunkin for some time I believed i attained the skills and profesionalism to look for work elsewhere. Thus landing me my next job at a local grocery store. Continuing to gain my people skills and good work ethic I was lucky enough to fall into my next job as a factory worker. From then until present day this is where I work.</p>

          <h2>Goals</h2>
          <p>My goal is to become a front-end web developer. In order to achieve this goal I need to learn these skills:</p>
          <ul class="skills">
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JAVASCRIPT</li>
            <li>REACT</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I’ve always wanted to work for a big tech or media company until recently I didnt know how that would be possible. After learning these tech skills I know I will be one step closer</p>
